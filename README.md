# Logistic Matrix Factorization for Implicit Feedback Data
Collaborative Filtering with implicit feedback data involves recommender system techniques for analyzing relationships betwens users and items
using implicit signals such as click through data or music streaming play counts to provide users with personalized recommendations. This is
in constrast to collaborative filtering with explicit feedback data which aims to model these relationships using explicit signals such as
user-item ratings. Since most data on the web comes in the form of implicit feedback data there is an increasing demand for collaborative filtering
methods that are designed for the implicit case. In this paper we present Logistic Matrix Factorization (logistic MF), a new probabilistic model for
matrix factorization with implicit feedback. The model is simple to implement, highly parallelizable and has the added benefit that it can model the
probability that a user will prefer a specific item. Additionally, we show it to experimentally outperform the widely adopted Implicit Matix Factorization method using a
dataset composed of music listening behavior from streaming music company Spotify.
